## Force Close Apps Automatically


This code will force close apps which are get removed or swiped away inside ur recent drawer



This script can be run using the sh command on the Android terminal. Note that the broadcast receiver will continue to listen for the `android.intent.action.CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS` intent even after the script is finished executing, so it will automatically force close the app whenever it is removed from the recent app drawer.
