## Force Close Apps Automatically


This script will `allow` apps with the package names listed in the `allowed_apps.conf` to `run in the background`, while `all other apps will be force stopped`. If the current app is not in the list, all other apps will be force stopped every second.

Keep in mind that you will need to have `root access`
